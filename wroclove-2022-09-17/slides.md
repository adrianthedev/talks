# What is a Rails Engine

<div class="flex flex-col">
  <div class="flex space-x-2 justify-between w-full">
    <div class="w-1/2">
      <img src="/img/engine.jpg" class="" />
    </div>
    <div class="flex h-1/2">
      <img v-click="2" src="/img/minime.jpg" class="h-[250px]" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div v-click="1" class="flex-1 mt-16">
    Engines can be considered miniature applications that provide functionality to their host application.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="flex align-center justify-center">
  <img v-click="3" src="/img/engines.jpg" class="h-[250px] -top-[300px] relative" />
</div>

<!--
- What is an engine?
- They have their own... and they are miniature apps inside the host app
- Example of marketplace with two engines

First of all, what is a Rails engine and why should we use one?
Engines can be considered miniature applications that provide functionality to their host application.
Engines help us group pieces of functionality that should be together.

More than that, each engine comes with it's own routes, controllers, views, models and everything you got used to when spinnng up a new Rails app. It's basically a mini rails app that can talk, in code, with your parent app.

If you're building a multi-tenancy app like a marketplace, you might have your own app, an engine for buyers and an engine for sellers. So you'll have three separate apps. The main app, the sellers app and the buyers app. So you'll be able to keep each domain under in it's own separate space.
**Rails itself is a supercharged engine.**
-->

# Sharing is caring

<div class="flex items-center justify-center">
  <img v-click src="/img/avo_the_best.jpg" class="" />
</div>

<!--
- This is a perfect setup for when you have engines just for yourself, but you might want to distribute your engines to more developers (maybe think of an example that is rememberable like "your coworker needs that thing too..."). Like, for example, you're building an admin panel framework for Rails apps.
- Pause
- So let's start building.
-->

---

# Generate an engine

```
rails plugin new admin --mountable
```

<img v-click src="/img/generate_app.jpg" alt="">
<img v-click src="/img/generate_test.jpg" class="relative transform -translate-y-full">

<!-- We'll run the new plugin command and are going to choose the mountable option.
This way we get the engine, dummy app, version file, the gemspec file, and other goodies we need to for packaging and distribution.

You might wonder what the dummy app does. It's there to help you test your engine. Test it as in automated tests or manual tests. -->

---

# Main functionality

 - find our models
 - display them on the sidebar and create a route for each one
 - show all records in their separate page


<img v-click src="/img/admin_demo.gif" />

<!--
- So let's add some functionality to our engine.

It's going to find our models from the parent app, show them on the sidebar and create links to pages where we quickly display the records.

I'm not going to build the whole admin panel framework here. You can check out Avo by yourselves. It's definitely better than this :P
-->

---

# Test your engine


```ruby
require "test_helper"

module Admin
  class ResourcesControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
    include Engine.routes.url_helpers

    test "the dashboard loads" do
      get admin.root_path
      assert_response :success
    end
  end
end
```

<img src="/img/test_output.jpg" class="w-128" />

<!-- Let's add a test to make sure nothing breaks when we push changes. -->
---

# Packaging

<img v-click src="/img/rubygems.jpg" alt="">

<!-- Ok. So now we have some functionality to pass around to our fellow developers. What's the easiest way of sending it their way? Make a gem. -->

<!--
Before we go ahead and pakage it, we need to fill in some information in our gemspec. The gemspec file is like the `package.json` file in a npm package.
It holds all the description for the gem and some metadata information required by rubygems to host it on their platform.

In the first section we fill in the basic information like the name, the authors, and description.
Next comest the metadata needed by rubygems and other websites to properly identify your package.
The files option tells the gem tool what files to pack. You might have a node_modules directory inside your project and you probably shouldn't package that.
Last but not least, this is where you specify what dependencies your gem requires. The dependencies declared here are going to be read by the parent application and taken into account when the user runs a `bundle install`.

You also have a `Gemfile`, but that's used only for the dummy app. So if there's anything you need on runtime in the parent app, put it in the `gemspec`.-->
---

# Build the thing

```
bundle exec rails build
```

<img src="/img/rails_build.gif" class="mt-10 ">

<!--
After we finish up updating all that information we can fire up the build command.

This will use the `files` configuration in your `gemspec`, take all of them and bundle them up in a `.gem` file.
-->
---

# Build in isolation

```docker{all|1|3|6-7|9|11-13|15|18|21|23}
FROM ruby:3.1.0

RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -yqq build-essential apt-transport-https apt-utils

# Cache nokogiri
RUN apt-get install -yqq libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
RUN gem install nokogiri selenium-webdriver ffi ruby-debug-ide tilt

RUN gem install bundler -v 2.3.5

ENV RAILS_ENV=production
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV BUNDLE_WITHOUT=development:test

WORKDIR /admin/

# Copy the files
COPY . /admin

# Run bundle install
RUN bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3

RUN bundle exec rails build
```

<!--
What I like to do is to sometimes build the gem in isolation.

I do that because there might be files in those paths that I don't want to ship with this release, or the compiled assets might contain unwanted changes, the env variables might not be right,  so I prefer to do it in isolation.

I do that using a docker where I start from a ruby image, copy the project, install my dependencies, and compile the assets again. This way the build process becomes idempotent and the resulted artifact is the same for a given state of files.

I use this workflow to publish prerelease versions with quickfixes and tryout features.
-->

---

# Helper script

```bash{all|3|5|6|7|8}
# scripts/build.sh

VERSION=$(bundle exec rails runner 'puts Admin::VERSION')

docker build -t admin-build -f docker/Dockerfile .
IMAGE_ID=$(docker create admin-build)
rm -f ./pkg/latest-admin.gem
docker cp $IMAGE_ID:/admin/pkg/admin-$VERSION.gem ./pkg/latest-admin.gem
```
<!-- The previous step only builds the gem, it doesn't really output anything in the local environment. I have a helper script that does that.

- takes the version
- builds the image
- gets the image id
- removes the old gem if found. I do that in case docker fails and actually doesn't build it right and then I risk uploading the wrong gem file.
- and copy the built gem file from docker to the local environment

- Cool! what's left?
-->
---

# Publish the thing!

<div v-click>

```
gem push --host https://rubygems.org/ ./pkg/latest-admin.gem
```

</div>
<img v-click src="/img/push.webp" class="mt-12">

<!-- Next, you publish that file to rubygems using a `gem push` command. You need to register an account and authenticate your environment with rubygems before pushing.

There it is. You published your work to the world. Now, anyone cam come in and use your thing.

When your developer friend wants to use it they add the gem to their gemfile and mount the engine in their routes file.
Now they can go to that route and use your gem. -->

# Good job!

  <div class="flex items-center ">
    <img v-click src="/img/applause.webp" class="">
  </div>
</div>

<!-- This is cool! You built something that someone else is using. But how do we go about when we want to introduce new features? We do that using versioning. -->

---

# Versioning

<!-- <div class="flex align-center justify-center h-10/12">
  <img src="/img/incoming.webp" class="">
</div> -->

<div v-click>

```diff
# lib/admin/version.rb
module Admin
-  VERSION = "0.1.0"
+  VERSION = "0.2.0"
end
```

</div>

<div v-click>

```
bundle install
```

</div>

<div v-click>

### Bump gem

[gregorym/bump](https://github.com/gregorym/bump)

</div>
<!-- The generated plugin comes with a `version.rb` file that is used in the package and read by rubygems when we push it.

In order to update the version you simply need to increment the version number in the version file and run `bundle` to have that reflected in the gemfile lock.

There is the `bump` gem that helps you with this. You run the bump command with a major, minor, or patch argument and it will do it for you. It will bump the version number, run the bundle command and even cut a tag and commit the changes for you if that's what you need.
 -->
---

# Release notes

<img v-click src="/img/release_notes.jpg" alt="">

<!-- It's nice that for every release to have dedicated release notes that outline what changed from one release to another.

There are a few ways of doing that. You can have one large `Changelog.md` file in you repo and fill it in manually with all that happened; you can use a page on your website or docs page; you might use Confluence, or you can use GitHub Releases.

With Avo we use GH releases. We tag each new version with a git tag and create a release on GH with a changelog.
I'll talk more about releases later. -->

---

# Updates workflow


<div v-click>


 - checkout a new branch
 - add your changes and commit
 - push to GitHub and open a PR
 - merge the PR
 - pull the `main` branch
 - bump the version number
 - build the gem and push to rubygems
 - update the changelog

</div>

<!-- It's a bit too much, I know. But don't worry... -->

---

# Automate all the things

<img src="/img/automate.webp" alt="">

<!-- ...we can automate the process.  -->
---

# Github Actions

<img src="/img/github_actions.gif" alt="">

<!-- We're going to use GitHub Actions to do it.

GitHub Actions and other CI systems work by using a yaml file as configuration. You basically tell it when to run ceratin tasks (when you create/update/close PRs, when you push code, on a designated time or on the push of a button), you give it the configuration using environment variables and secrets, and you tell it what to do; what tasks to run.

GA also has a marketplace of pre-made actions ready for you to use like git checkout, setup ruby, add caching layers, label PRs, trigger other automations, and much much more.

This is the basic setup. You can go wild after this. Add caching layers for bundler and yarn, install multiple databases, run the tests in matrixes testing against multiple ruby or Rails versions, spit out artifacts with screenshots when tests fail, generate coverage, and much much more.
You can find a few of these enhancements in Avo's test.yml file. I'm happy to help anyone with explaining how they work.

Now, if the tests fail, the jobs shows up as failed on the PR page. -->

We use a popular tagging scheme where we divide PRs into `features`, `fixes`, `chores`, or `refactors`.

The way we automate is with another action called `pr-labeler-action`. It will read the branch name and figure out from there what kind of PR this is.
This way we can build the release notes automatically more easily.

You can go wild and use multiple strategies to read from the PR body, and probably from the commit messages too, but this is what works for us.

<!--
You might have guessed it. We're going to use a pre-made action for this step. We'll use the `release-drafter` GH action.

We run this after we merge a PR. It will make a diff between the last release and the current HEAD and identify all the merged PRs. Then it will create a draft release on GH with the PRs neatly separated into categories. This also pulls out the author of the PR and adds a reference to that PR which GH nicely turns into a link.

We also get a nice list with all the contributors for that release. -->
